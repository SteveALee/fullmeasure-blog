*** An Outline Learning by Ear Process ***

If been trying to learn music "ear-first", ie without reading scores first. My process is currently:

* listen to the song / piece lots and lots and lots. Just soak it in. 
* active listening to answer questions like a what's the form, key, what instruments play when, articulations etc etc
* using suitable software loop a small section
* try to sing the numbers of the melody or bassline
* find the notes on instrument to check
* slow down if required
* separate out instrument/voice stem only if really needed.
* rinse and repeat, recalling previously learnt bits
* probably explore harmony (chords), often as part of step 2, active listening for form. Eg it's 12 bar blues
* record somehow as you build up for fall back reminder, I might use stick and solfeg (numbers) rather than full score notation. Maybe record yourself singing the Numbers of the melody.
* later do tapered recall to fix it.
