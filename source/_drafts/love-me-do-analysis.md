Well analysing that was immense fun and a great way to get back to MusicalU! I decided to work though myself and explore the the listening guide later. Never done it before and loved it. I did peek at and appreciate others work above :)

One overall impression after listening to this multiple times is it's not the simple "old" song I might have thought. There's so much craft in there!

So first the highlevel structure/form. It's interesting as not really typical verse + chorus to my mind and the verse is more a chorus.

intro / chorus / chorus / bridge / chorus / instrumental / chorus / outro

Seems to be key of G in 4/4 at about 150 bpm. Drums, bass, guitar, harmonica, vocals and vocal harmony.

What's fascinating is each "chorus" is made up of 2 parts with a "pause" bar in the middle, giving 8 + 1 + 4 bars. The end of the instrumental alsoÂ  has a short pause but it's short and part of the 12 bars,

The hook is introduced in the intro with a second variation and is a lovely harmonica riff that feels a little plaintiff, matching the songs topic. This is repeated at the end of each chorus along with a refrane of the key vocal phrase.

The bridge and instrumental (middle 12) shift harmonically to D chord (I think), as introduced by the descending bass.

The drums stay pretty constant through out - except the pause bars of course. :)

Bass line is simple mostly 2 notes through out

Guitar strums on

Harmonica changes melody from the hook in the bridge and instrumental

Vocals are harmony in the main 8 bars of each chorus and single in the last 4 bars of chorus and bridge.

Outro is an extension of last 4 bars of chorus.

Having done this work I really appreciate the song now. Or was it just a result of the zillion times i listened to it :D What's next....
