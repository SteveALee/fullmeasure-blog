The great thing about being an adult learner of music is that you get to pick your own learning approach. At this stage in my adventure I have some instrument skills on bass guitar and double bass, as well as being able to poke a keyboard. Further I have some basic pitch, rhythm and harmonic understanding. Along side this I've learnt about neuroscience and how to apply it for effective adult learning. Now, as a result of exploring various learning resources I've arrived at what I think is a good set of learning objectives. While this is different to typical school music education it is not revolutionary, rather, it builds on traditional ear first musical techniques and the latest understanding of adult learning. 

This post summarises some of the resources that keep me engaged and moving in the right direction. But first I outline my vision and the key learning objectives that I think will lead to it.

# Vision

  "Being able to have musical conversations"

That means being able to play by ear in the moment, reacting to what others are playing (saying). In other words "improvisation" in a very broad sense, not just impressive jazz solos by master musicians. Rather the ability to hear, think of something to say and play it. It might be a bass line in an unstructured "Jam Session", a solo in the content of a Jazz group playing a standard, a new chorus melody for a song or even a full on composition.

The key aspect here is being "ear first", listening and creating in the moment. While theory, notation and instrument learnt specific licks or scales are all important, they support the ear first approach. Not the other way round. 

I have a picture of musical learning that is closely analogous to learning a language. It means learning to listen, audiate and reproduce using musical "atoms" and language rules. Our voice is our natural instrument with which we are intimately familiar for generating sound and pitches. Our body is primed to respond to and generate rhythm. So singing and body movement are going to be key, even though I'm not really happy with my ability to do either in a pleasant way. Luckily we now know how to get the adult brain to learn effectively.

    - intentional practice
    - desirable difficulty
    - spaced recall
    - visualisation

  - pitch relative to tonal centre
  - feeling rhythm
- instrument skills

  - to support ear first
- harmony and counterpoint
- musical languages and improvisation
- performing
- teachers, courses and tools

# Resources

These are the resources I have found to be and still find to be the most useful in my musical journey

## A Good Teacher

Essential, at least to start with to set you on the right path and later to address specific issues.

## Christopher Sutton and team's MusicalU

https://www.musical-u.com/

The first modern resource that really impressed me in so many ways. With a background in ear training apps they now cover most topics in ear first musicality. A keen team suported by excellent tutors delivering fantastic courses and instrument packs, along with an active and supportive community. There is also an excellent podcast on music learning. For me as a bass player having the unique Steve Lawson as the resident bass pack tutor is incredibly good fortune. I took up the VIP full access option and admire them so much I have even been on the technical team. Do check them out!

## David Reed and Miriea Clua's Improvise for Real

https://improviseforreal.com/

Ear and voice training with a method book, resources and courses providing a simple and effective approach to internalise melody and harmony. Keeping the key central avoids the need to learn chord scales modes. The ear training course is my current focus of attention and is the most effective and enjoyable approach I have found so far.

## Josh Turknett's BrainJo

https://www.brainjo.academy/

Josh is a musician and neuroscientist and has produced a book, website and method that teach learning to play well by growing a musical brain. I'm currently reading the Laws of BrainJo book and it is a very enjoyable.
