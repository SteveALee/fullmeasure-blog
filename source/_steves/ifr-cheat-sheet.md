A brief summary of IFR principles for Deep Foundations:

- Slow down and smell the flowers - quiet, relaxed contemplation
- The tonal map numbers are key
  - Visualise the tonal map at first - later recall the rules it encapsulates
  - Think the number as you play
  - Aim to sing the numbers as often as possible when playing (if can)
  - Focus on meditative awareness of feelings invoked by each number in the harmonic environment
  - Use the [Sing the Numbers](https://improviseforreal.com/products/sing-numbers-1-ifr-tonal-map) exercises (and Feel the Numbers from the ear training course)
- Audiate before playing - slow down so you can do so
- Play in all twelve keys
- Mentally overlay the tonal map on your instrument (if possible)
- Watch [David's Main Lessons](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/main-lessons/) for the details of IFR and Mireia's [Ear Training Lessons](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/ear-training-lessons/) to embark on your journey. 
- All videos in the Instrument Room offer powerful insights, whatever you play, but definitely watch Jelske's [Melodic Instruments Lessons](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/melodic-instruments-lessons/) for fantastic musical ideas.
- Make the most of Mireia's [Singing Tracks](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/audio-tracks/) and [Jam Tracks](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/jam-tracks/)
- Embrace Jelske's "Trading 4s" tracks as they are especially valuable for practicing all aspects of IFR in one fun activity.
- Use tools for random practice.
