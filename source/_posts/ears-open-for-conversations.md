The great thing about being an adult learner of music is that you get to pick your own learning approach. At this stage in my adventure I have some instrument skills on bass guitar and double bass, along with basic pitch, rhythm and harmonic understanding. As a result of exploring various learning resources I've arrived at what I think is a good set of learning objectives. While this is different to typical school music education it is not at all revolutionary. Rather, it builds on traditional musical techniques and the more recent better understanding of effective learning techniques for adults. 

This post summarises some of the resources that keep me engaged and moving in the right direction. But first I outline the key learning objectives that I think will lead to my vision of

  "Being able to have musical conversations with others"

That means being able to play by ear in the moment, reacting to what others are playing (saying). In other words "improvisation" in a very broad sense, not just impressive jazz solos by master musicians. Rather the ability to hear, think of something to say and play it. It might be a bass line in an unstructured "Jam Session", a solo in the content of a Jazz group playing a standard, a new chorus melody for a song or even a full on composition.

The key aspect here is being "ear first", listening and creating in the moment. While theory, notation and instrument learnt specific licks or scales are all important, they support the ear first approach. Not the other way round. 

I have a picture of musical learning that is closely analogous to learning a language. Luckily we now know how to get the adult brain to learn effectively. It means learning to listen, audiate and reproduce using musical "atoms" and language rules. Our voice is our natural instrument with which we are intimately familiar for generating sound and pitches. Our body is primed to respond to and generate rhythm. So singing and body movement are going to be key, even though I'm not really happy with my ability to do either in a pleasant way.

# Resources

These are the resources I have found to be and still find to be the most useful in my musical journey

## A Good Teacher

Essential, at least to start with to set you on the right path and later to address specific issues.

## Musical U

The first modern resource that really impressed me in many ways. They have a keen team and many excellent tutors delivering fantastic courses and instrument packs, along with an active and supportive community. There is also an excellent podcast on music leanring. As a bass player, having the unique Steve Lawson as the resident tutor is incredibly good fortune. I took up the VIP full access option and have even been on the technical team. Do check them out!

Josh is a musician and neuroscientist and has produced a book and website that really present learning to play well and are very enjoyable read.
