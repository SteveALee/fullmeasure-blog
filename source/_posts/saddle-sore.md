Last post I declared I was "back in the saddle" having started to play the double bass again. The thing is, I soon got very saddle sore! After 7 months rest, the old bass feels awkward to handle, let alone ballance. Plus I've lost my calluses and left hand pain indicated terrible technique that stops any smooth playing.

So a quick change of plans and I decided to quickly work trough Geoff Chamber's excellent Beginners course on Discover Double Bass. My thinking was that would provide a solid recap to whizz through and I could concentrate on getting the basics right again.

First though, I put in place a daily warm up design to get back into good habits and started Geoff's lessons. 

- 15 min semi supine (Alexander Technique) and deep relaxation with 7 / 11 breathing and Physiological Sign
- 5 min shoulder rolls, hand tendon warmup and Cowling's exercises
- 5 min balancing bass, left hand string press plus hammer ons, full string glissando and thumb position body adjustment with string press (ala Ruffus Reid)
- 5 min long and short bows (ala Rufus Reid etc)
- 5 min pizz on open strings for timing (ala Danny Zeimann)
- 5 min Chromatic scale down string - to be replaced with full arpeggios (ala Danny Zeimann)

I soon got to some enjoyable music making with Geoff's "Stand By Me" bass bass line lesson. This threw up more technique issues though. Mostly my left hand being much too tight and so hurting. String crossing from C to G in half position was as rough and slow as it could be! As was the G, B step up back to C.

So time to dig in to some serious practice. But rather than being all adult and outcome led so getting despondent I decided be more child like and milk it for all the fun and gains I could. Time to put those neuroscience based adult learning "encoding" ideas into practice along with a music-first approach. Also a tip from Danny Ziemann was to start with the entire song, then break it down before putting it back together again. That means you have clear context to aim for. That was something I usually missed out, diving straight into the detailed parts. 

Geoff provides a "Stand by Me" lesson video starting with him playing along to the provided backing track and that's what I used. He next goes through the fingering and also provides a PDF of the score. However I decided a music-first approach avoids starting with the outline technique or score, Rather we start with the music and figure out the form, Solfeg for melody plus harmony, and rhythm. This is something Danny recently led us though in a workshop and there;s discomfort at the start but results do follow.

- Download the video and use Transcribe! to select Geoff's playing at the start (also useful for marking bars, slow down, EQ etc to help with analysis)
- Loop and practice active listening to get familiar with every detail, but especially the bass line
- Analyze form, esp when chords change and understand any patterns
- Internalise "melody" by singing Solfeg and rhythm by stepping and clapping etc (Dave Smith). 
- Break down ad isolate issues as required but keep singing clapping and playing along to the music as a preference
- Play slowly building up more and more complexity. Eg start with chore root note Semibreve for each bar, then add two first root notes per bar etc.
- Switch to the backing track at some point (usually better than Transcribe!'s bass removal)
- At all stages fully focus but enjoy listening or playing along to the music and don't worry about how "good" your are.
- Think of creative ways to make it harder - improvise and solo too
- Have many rest breaks and let the brain carry on working on it while you chill or interleave (esp when sleeping)

That seems to work well and it's great to start playing along with the chord roots rather them working a bar at a time in isolation to the music. It definitely suites having a little post concussion syndrome, though that is mostly gone now.

So as I result of a couple of short sessions I can reasonably play something musical on the bass again! Next we need to work on recall with spaced repetition. Record and review to fix any remaining issues.
