A brief summary of IFR principles for Deep Foundations:

- Slow down and smell the flowers - quiet, relaxed contemplation
- The tonal map numbers are key
  - Visualise the tonal map at first - later recall the rules it encapsulates
  - Think the number as you play
  - Aim to sing the numbers as often as possible when playing (if can)
  - Focus on meditative awareness of feelings invoked by each number in the harmonic environment
  - Use the [Sing the Numbers](https://improviseforreal.com/products/sing-numbers-1-ifr-tonal-map) exercises (and Feel the Numbers from the ear training course)
- Audiate before playing - slow down so you can do so
- Play in all twelve keys
- Mentally overlay the tonal map on your instrument (if possible)
- Use Mireia's [Singing Tracks](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/audio-tracks/) and [Jam Tracks](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/jam-tracks/)
- Use Musical Parameter files for random practice
  - [Tonal Map](https://parameters.musicpracticetools.net/?file=/examples/IFR-Tonal-Map-Start.yaml)
  - [Jam Tracks](https://parameters.musicpracticetools.net/?file=https://blog.fullmeasure.uk/_steves/IFR-Jam-Tracks-Media.yaml&mediaRoot=d3rl7arpgnbsx6.cloudfront.net/j1_7w_mp3)
- Watch Jelske's [Melodic Instruments Lessons](https://forum.improviseforreal.com/c/melodic-instruments-lessons/) for fantastic musical ideas, whatever instrument you play
