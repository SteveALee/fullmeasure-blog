## Using MuseScore to provide backing tracks from scores for music practice

I'm studying for ABRSM Grade 1 on double bass which requires 3 pieces to be learn't. Each has piano accompaniment but no audio tracks are provided with the books containing the pieces and I don't have access to a plano player. It turns out MuseScore comes to the rescue with a really simple solution.

I was about to manually enter the dots into MuseScore when I wondered if I might be able to scan in. I expected the answer to be be "yes if you purchase expensive software" but my first web search threw up MuseScore own free service at https://musescore.com/user/login?destination=%2Fimport (you need a free account to access). This service is built on the [Audiveris](https://github.com/Audiveris) open source project and works much better than I expected.

To get workign backing track you sinmply:

1. Scan you score to pdf (I used the Epson Scan tool which handles multiple pages).
2. Upload to the MuseScore service and wait for the MuseScore file to become available for download.
3. Load the file into MuseScore and hit play.

In reality, you might need to tweek the file a bit for best results. For example, I had to change the voice and stop it transposing up an octave. I'll also need need to tweak the dynamics and articulations. But as you can see it did an excellent job, including ignoreing my had drawn arco notations.
