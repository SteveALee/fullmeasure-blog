I found the output level of the [Realist LifeLine piezo pickup](https://www.davidgage.com/lifeline.php2) on my double bass to be way too low for the [PJB double Four amp](https://www.pjbworld.com/cms/index.php/product_bg-75/) or Boss looper pedal I use for home practice.

From my electronics days I recall that the piezo idea of high impedance (Z) is much higher than wire wound pickups and so I needed a buffer amp designed for these. I looked around for a simple and convenient amp I could definitely use and was just about to give up when I stumbled upon the [Creation Audio Labs Redeemer](https://www.creationaudiolabs.com/redeemer), with its 20 MOhm input Z (note several reviews say 2). The only other one I found that appeared to come close to my requirements is the similarly priced [Fishman Platinum Stage Analog Preamp](https://www.fishman.com/portfolio/platinum-stage-eq-di-analog-preamp-pro-plt-301/). While it's extra controls might be useful when [eventually] gigging, for my home use I didn't want all the extra controls, preferring simple electronics. EQ can be handled elsewhere in the signal chain.

I went for the Belt version of the Redeemer as it comes with low capacitance cable and that seemed safer than the inline version, which might be different as quoted as being designed for pedal board use. It's probably identical electronics though as the redeemer looks to be flexible. I'd prefer a power supply option but as I use rechargeable PP3 batteries the Belt version lack should be OK.

I did have a slight concern that the gain might not be enough for my purposes (it's not specified).

But no fear, it's perfect and sounds great! I'm sure a blended pickup plus mic mix would best capture the sound of the bass. But for now I'm happy.

I was planning to try other cable lengths once I sourced some short decent low capacitance cables. The image on the website show an input socket but sadly I got a captured cable, so am a bit stuck. The problem is the cable length is wrong for either my belt or the floor (I have the bass' pin at max length). So I'll have to find a way to mount the box onto the bass to avoid strain on the cable with the dangling box. A bit of velcro to mount it on the pin cables might work out.

Another minor niggle is I find if I touch the case I get hum. Perhaps the case is not linked to the cable shield?.

Bit all in all, a great solution to my need.
