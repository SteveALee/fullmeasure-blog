Following the common practice in open source projects, here is a collection of awesome musicality tools, resources, videos and shiny things. For now I'm only including bass guitar related awesomeness.

## Develop Skills

- [studybass.com](http://www.studybass.com/) a website chock full of solid bass lessons, tools and more. Mostly free.
- [Musical U](https://www.musical-u.com/) excellent musicality learning resources. Pick your own course from many modules or follow courses like 'The Musician's Ear', 'Foundations of a Musical Mind' and 'The Circle of Fifths'. Instrument specific packs include bass by Steve Lawson. Reasonable price given the quantity and quality of modules.

## Watch and Listen

- [Musicality Now podcast](https://www.musical-u.com/learn/topic/podcast/) - full of interviews about musicality and more by the Musical U team. More recent episodes include video as well as audio.

## People

- [Steve Lawson - Solo Bass Steve](https://www.stevelawson.net/) Mr awesome himself, pushing the boundaries of bass playing and musical sustainability. Oh, and a really nice guy too. Do yourself a favour and subscribe to his bandcamp.
