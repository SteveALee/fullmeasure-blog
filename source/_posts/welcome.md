## Welcome to Steve's little music and tech emporium

Welcome to FullMeasure. My place on the "interwebs" where I blog about my experiences as an adult learn of music. I'll also share any useful tools I develop to help me on the way.

As I describe in the [About page](/about) I had a bad experience of music education at school but am now trying to correct that. I'm driven by a deep love of and keen fascination with all aspects of music and the people who engage with it in many ways.

Hopefully others will find this interesting.

My first post will ba catch up wih where I am at now and how the recent [London Bass Guitar Show](https://www.ukguitarshow.com/) help me figure a few things out.
